# Architectural Design

Product is built on a robust and scalable architecture designed to meet the evolving needs of users while ensuring data security and compliance.

## Key Components

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each functional area (data integration, analysis, query engine, etc.) operates as a separate microservice, facilitating scalability and independent updates.
- **Cloud-Native Design with Multi-Cloud Support**: Cloud-native technologies and design principles, ensuring compatibility with AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure to avoid vendor lock-in and enhance resilience.
- **Data Lake and Warehouse**: Centralized data lake for raw data storage and a data warehouse for structured, query-optimized data storage, supporting diverse analytics and machine learning needs.
- **API-First Approach**: Designing with APIs at the forefront to ensure seamless integration between services, external data sources, and third-party applications, facilitating ecosystem connectivity.
- **Security and Compliance Layer**: A dedicated layer to enforce security policies, authentication, authorization, and data privacy compliance across all services and data access points.

## Technology Stack

- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Utilizing Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring seamless deployment and scalability across the cloud environment.
- **Data Processing and Analytics**: Employing technologies such as Apache Spark for big data processing and analytics capabilities.
- **Machine Learning and AI**: Incorporating TensorFlow and PyTorch for developing and training advanced machine learning models to drive insights and automation.
- **Database Management**: Leveraging both SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases for flexible and scalable data storage solutions.

## Security Features

- **Data Encryption**: Ensuring all data, both at rest and in transit, is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing OAuth 2.0 and JWT for robust access control and secure authentication mechanisms.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Designing the system to be compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data protection and privacy regulations, ensuring global operability and user trust.
